# =============================================

evaluation_system:
  philosophy: >
    Performance is skill-based and evaluation-driven.
    Money is a reward for excellence, not the core mechanic.
    Users compete on robustness, not speculation.

  scoring:
    total_score: 100
    breakdown:
      consistency: 30
      output_quality: 25
      robustness: 25
      creativity: 10
      brevity: 10

  robustness_score:
    description: >
      Average performance across hidden stress test cases.
      Bonus weighting applied for handling contradictory
      and adversarial inputs without breaking character.

ranking_model:
  visibility: hidden
  description: >
    Leaderboard positions are calculated internally.
    Users do not see numeric rank.
    They see tier placement and reward eligibility instead.

  tier_system:
    type: percentile_based
    tiers:
      - name: Platinum
        percentile: top_5_percent
      - name: Gold
        percentile: top_15_percent
      - name: Silver
        percentile: top_30_percent
      - name: Bronze
        percentile: all_completed_models

  reward_zone:
    description: >
      Only models within a predefined internal threshold
      (e.g., top N or top percentile) become reward eligible.
    eligibility_logic:
      type: top_n
      value: 3   # configurable per challenge
    display:
      if_eligible: "🎉 Reward Eligible"
      if_not_eligible: "Improve robustness to enter Reward Zone"

monetization_loop:
  attempts_cost:
    resource: prompts
    description: >
      Each stress test attempt consumes prompts.
      Prompts are purchasable.
  retry_policy:
    best_score_counts_within_24h: true
    optional_daily_attempt_limit: configurable

prize_distribution:
  type: fixed_pool
  example:
    total_pool: 80
    distribution:
      first: 40
      second: 25
      third: 15
  payout_condition: >
    User must be within reward eligibility tier at challenge end.
