* AI enthusiasts
* Prompt engineers
* Technical creators

---

## **Challenge Types**

1. **Recreation Challenges**

   * User is shown a target output (image, text, or structured result)
   * Goal: write a prompt that reproduces the target as closely as possible

2. **Problem-Solving Challenges**

   * User is shown a task or question
   * Goal: write a prompt that solves the task accurately and efficiently

3. **Optimization Challenges**

   * Goal: achieve the best result using fewer tokens, better structure, or higher consistency

## **Invisible Leaderboard System**

* Maintains real-time internal rankings of all users
* Rankings are **never shown** to users

  * Estimate potential earnings
  * Determine final reward eligibility
* Ensures fair competition without social pressure

---

## **XP & Reward Mechanics**

* **XP** is awarded immediately after prompt evaluation
* **Coins and cash rewards are ephemeral**
* Before submission, the system calculates and displays:

  * XP target for the attempt
  * Estimated coin reward if target is met
* Final rewards are distributed only when a challenge round ends

---

## **Dynamic XP Targeting**

* XP targets are personalized per user
* Targets are based on:

  * User performance history
  * Current round competitiveness
  * Invisible leaderboard distribution
* Users may refresh targets within system limits
* Refreshing generates a new target without revealing rank

---

## **Prompt Evaluation**

* User prompts are executed against selected AI models
* Output is scored using:

  * Similarity comparison (for recreation tasks)
  * Accuracy and correctness checks
  * Efficiency and clarity metrics
* Scores determine XP allocation

---

## **Economy Flow**

```
Prompt Submission → XP Awarded → XP Accumulates
→ Coins Calculated (Pending) → Round Ends
→ Coins Finalized → Cash Redeemable
```

* XP is permanent
* Coins are redeemable
* Cash payouts are subject to platform rules
* Platform retains a percentage for sustainability and prize pools

---

## **Rounds & Tournaments**

* Challenges run in time-boxed rounds
* Each round has:

  * A prize pool
  * XP thresholds

* Multiple tables and championship rounds supported internally
* Advancement is implicit, not displayed publicly

---

## **User Experience Rules**

  * XP bars
  * Milestones
  * Pending reward indicators
* Competition feels personal, not comparative
* Results are revealed only at round completion

---
